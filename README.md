# LLMs4OL: Large Language Models for Ontology Learning 



Ontology Learning (OL) addresses the challenge of knowledge acquisition and representation  in a variety of domains. Recent advances in NLP and the emergence of Large Language Models, which have shown a capability to be good at crystallizing knowledge and patterns from vast text sources, we introduced the **LLMs4OL: Large Language Models for Ontology Learning** paradigm as a empirical study of LLMs for automated construction of ontologies from various domains.  The LLMs4OL paradigm tests *Does the capability of LLMs to capture intricate linguistic relationships translate effectively to OL, given that OL mainly relies on automatically extracting and structuring knowledge from natural language text?* from three core aspects of OL as tasks. They are presented as:

- Task A: Term Typing
- Task B: Type Taxonomy Discovery
- Task C: Type Non-Taxonomic Relation Extraction
